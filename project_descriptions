FitBook:
Led a team of three developers to create an app where users can record their workouts,
keep a log of custom exercises, and track their progress over time. Users can sign up securely,
create workouts consisting of exercises that they can create, track multiple stats
such as weight and notes on these exercises, and track their workouts on a responsive calendar. 
I led the team in planning features, reviewed development team code, and managed the git workflow. 
The app was made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Nodejs).

Conga Quest:
Created a snakelike game with elements of an RPG. 
You control a conga line of adventurers as you fight monsters in a dungeon. 
Use the arrow keys to move. Be careful not to crash into the enemies or walls. 
Try to kill as many enemies to get a new high score! 
Created using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
Utilized Object Oriented Programming to create code that is easy to scale complexity and features.

The Cord:
A clone of the Discord web app. 
Allows creation of a new user with user authentication, server and channel CRUD, and live messaging. 
Created using Ruby on Rails in the backend, PostgreSQL as a database, React as the frontend library 
and Redux as state management.
